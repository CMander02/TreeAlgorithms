Tree-shape data structures:

1. Binary Tree, blabla (Simple Conclusion of what we have learned)
2. Balanced Tree->AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Tree, B+Tree, B*Tree( Red-Black Tree typicaly)
3. KD-Tree, Binary Space Partitioning Tree(BSP Tree), and it's applications (E.X., 3D Rendering, another project about geographics)
4. QuadTree, Octree, 2^n-tree?(Mathematical Induction? What other can we talk about?)

---
First part of the project: Implement Red-Black Tree, AVL and B+ tree. 

Must have these functions:
- **insert**
- **delete**
- **search**
- **print**
- **rebalancing counting**
-  3 kinds of **traversal** methods. (inorder, preorder, postorder)

Second part of the project: Implement the comparison of peformances (RBT-AVL, RBT- B+) in these aspects:
- **insert**
- **delete**
- **search**
- **traversal**
- **time used for rebalancing**
- different size and randomness of data.

This part may have some problems like CMake, implementation of a universal time-scaling function (.h?), visualization and analysis of data, etc.

Note: all comparison must be done on **school's server**(to guarantee there's no difference in hardware).
