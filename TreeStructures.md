Tree-shape data structures:

1. Binary Tree, blabla (Simple Conclusion of what we have learned)
2. Balanced Tree->AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Tree, B+Tree, B*Tree( Red-Black Tree typicaly)
3. KD-Tree, Binary Space Partitioning Tree(BSP Tree), and it's applications (E.X., 3D Rendering, another project about geographics)
4. QuadTree, Octree, 2^n-tree?(Mathematical Induction? What other can we talk about?)

Talk about their properties, applications, and implementations.
Compare their performance and time complexity.
